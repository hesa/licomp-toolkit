# Licomp Toolkit - Reply Format

The previous format (0.3) was for checking a license against a
license, e.g. can I use outbound license when using a component under
inbound license given a specific context.

This format extends to looking at expressions (e.g. `MIT OR BSD-3-Clause`) instead. This new format will be much more complex so we will define sub formats, which will be used by the top format.
